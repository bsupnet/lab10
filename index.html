            <h2>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Techniques</h2>
            <p>Meta descriptions play a critical role in attracting users to websites from search engine result pages (SERPs). A compelling description provides a brief overview of a page's content, enticing visitors to click the link. The majority of people that are looking for an answer online through a search engine like google can read these descriptions and very quickly decern if your webpage has the fix to the problem for example, just by reading how accurate your description is. According to Moz (Petrescu, 2014), well-crafted meta descriptions can significantly improve click-through rates. As the more accurate the text is to the users desired information, the more attractive it is to click on.</p>
            <p>Heading tags, such as <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, help organize content and improve readability. These tags also signal the content's hierarchy to search engines, which can improve rankings (Clay, 2022). Including relevant keywords in headings enhances SEO. The article also talks about how important content organization and claims that businesses that optimize their websites content earn "55%" (Clay, 2022) more clicks as a by-product of trying to cater to what their users needs are </p>
            <p>Alt text for images is another essential SEO technique. It describes images for users with visual impairments and is indexed by search engines, increasing the chances of appearing in image searches (Valk, 2021). Meaningful alt text improves accessibility and search engine visibility. This also helps the image searching algorithm better understand what kind of picture you'd like to present, if it is extremely clear through your alt text the algorithm can easily place your picture with others like it. However, one should note that adding too much alt text to an image can get your website marked as spam (Valk, 2021) So finding the right balance between the perfect amount of information and minimal wording is extremely important</p>

            <h2>Social Media Optimization (SMO) Techniques</h2>
            <p>Adding a 'Facebook Like' button to a webpage can encourage users to engage with and share content on Facebook, boosting the site's reach. This increases inbound traffic and fosters user interaction (Lockard, 2013). In the comments of this article from over a decade ago, Google had pushed posts that even had a single interaction (Urban, 2013). A much simplier time of course, but an indicator that search engines will promote the webpages that have the most interaction. The search engine will recognize this post or profile to be popular and push it to individuals taking a dive into the niche. </p>
            <p>When Instagram posts are displayed on a website, they encourage visitors to explore and follow the associated Instagram account. This helps in building a stronger connection with the audience, as they can access real-time updates and additional content that may not be available on the website itself. According to Bhargava (2010), optimizing social media presence is key to increasing visibility and encouraging user interaction, both of which are crucial for building a loyal online audience. </p>
            <p>Using hashtags effectively in content is a powerful strategy for enhancing discoverability on social media platforms. Hashtags serve as searchable keywords, enabling content to reach a broader audience beyond a user’s immediate followers. By incorporating relevant and trending hashtags, creators can ensure that their posts are included in related conversations and search results, increasing visibility. This approach helps potential audiences discover the content organically, even if they were previously unaware of the brand or individual behind it. Lockard (2013) emphasizes that the strategic use of hashtags can lead to increased interactions, fostering stronger connections with users and driving valuable traffic back to the website.</p>
